🚀 Form Validation – Day 2
Description:

This is Day 2 of my Zero to Hero Coder journey.
In this project, I focused on building a user-friendly and accessible form validation system using JavaScript (Vanilla JS). It includes validation for required fields, email pattern checking, and error display with helpful messages.

The goal was to make form interactions smoother, smarter, and visually guided — ensuring users input the correct data before form submission.

🔧 Features:
✅ Required field validation
✅ Email pattern validation using regular expressions
✅ Multiple error messages with <ul><li> display
✅ Clean error handling with red borders and inline hints
✅ Uses Bootstrap 5 for responsive layout

🛠️ Tech Stack:
HTML5
CSS3 + Bootstrap 5
Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
